# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock, paper, scissors game. This time with a GUI!

The code needs refactoring as it became a bit of a mess, otherwise it works.

I played a lot of Alex Kidd in Miracle World on the Sega Master system when I was a kid and this particular miniproject reminded me of that, hence the theme.

The sprites came from [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/master_system/alexkiddmw/), a fantastic site if you need some sprites from one of your favourite games for a non-commercial project of some sort.

The music was clipped from this video of the game's boss battles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiSgOrdqyi4
